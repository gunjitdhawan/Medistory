Idea is to **predict all the diseases, disorders, allergies** etc that a person may be prone to or is currently experiencing on the basis of **genetics, previous health issues, geographical location, weather, vaccinations undertaken, Google Fit Data** and other internal or external factors and **recommend medical tests, home remedies**, etc. This app will also build a **medical history** for the user and doctor for future purposes.

 The app will present a questionnaire to the user on first app open, asking about all the relevant questions to build up an extensive medical history. This app will keep asking questions about the users well-being from time to time and alert users if they are prone to an upcoming threat. The **outcome/prediction of disease will be accomplished using machine learning.**

```Example 1 : If a user has a family history of chronic sore throat, then the app will warn user every time the weather changes or a major number of users in nearby area are experiencing the same disorder.```

```Example 2 : If a userâ€™s Google Fit data shows some anomalies in heart rate then the app can recommend some heart related tests or a visit to a cardiologist.```
